Nuvoton NPCM7XX I2C bus mux switch

Required properties:
- compatible      	 : must be "nuvoton,i2c-mux-npcm"
- i2c-parent	  	 : phandle of the I2C bus that this multiplexer's master-side
					   port is connected to.
- syscon		  	 : phandle of the syscon node to access GCR register.
- nuvoton,i2c-number : I2C parent number.
- i2c_segment_number : List of I2C segment number that aligned with used I2C
					   bus mux pins.

* Standard pinctrl properties that specify the pin mux state for each child
  bus. See ../pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt.

* Standard I2C mux properties. See i2c-mux.txt in this directory.

* I2C child bus nodes. See i2c-mux.txt in this directory.

Example:
		i2cmux0 {
			compatible = "i2c-mux-npcm";
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			i2c-parent = <&i2c1>;
			syscon = <&gcr>;
			nuvoton,i2c-number = <1>;

			pinctrl-names = "default";
			pinctrl-0 = <&smb1_pins &smb1b_pins &smb1d_pins>;
			i2c_segment_number = <0>, <1>, <3>;
			status = "okay";

			i2c@2 {
				reg = <2>;
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;
				status = "okay";

				eeprom {
					compatible = "atmel,24c04";
					reg = <0x50>;
					status = "okay";
				};
			};
		};
