Bindings for npcm8xx I3C master block
=====================================

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible: shall be "nuvoton,npcm845-i3c"
- clocks: shall reference the i3c module_clk and mclk
- clock-names: shall contain "pclk" and "fast_clk"
- interrupts: the interrupt line connected to this I3C master
- reg: Offset and length of I3C master registers
- pinctrl-names : a pinctrl state named "default" must be defined.
- pinctrl-0 : phandle referencing pin configuration of the controller.

Mandatory properties defined by the generic binding (see
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/i3c/i3c.txt for more details):

- #address-cells: shall be set to 3
- #size-cells: shall be set to 0

Optional properties defined by the generic binding (see
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/i3c/i3c.txt for more details):

- i2c-scl-hz
- i3c-scl-hz

I3C device connected on the bus follow the generic description (see
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/i3c/i3c.txt for more details).

Example:

	i3c0: i3c@fff10000 {
		compatible = "nuvoton,npcm845-i3c";
		reg = <0xfff10000 0x1000>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&i3c0_pins>;
		clocks = <&clk NPCM8XX_CLK_AHB>, <&clk NPCM8XX_CLK_RCP>;
		clock-names = "pclk", "fast_clk";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 224 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		#address-cells = <3>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
	};
